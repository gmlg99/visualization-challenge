Based on this analysis, there were four treatments tested for results in tumor size in mice with cancer. One can infer that Capomulin and Ramicane were the leading treatments. The average tumor size was cubic milimiters. Infubinol had an outlier with a value of 36 cubic milimiters whereas Ceftamin had larger outliers at 53 cubic milimiters. Capomulin had the strongest correlation of .84. As a conclusion, Capomulin and Ramincane worked the best and it is of great importance to keep in mind the weight of each mice on Capulin, due to the increased size of the tumor.
